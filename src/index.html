                                While trying to eat healthy, proper intake of vitamins and minerals is just as important. Although minerals do many functions in the body, the major role is to help regulate enzymatic reactions. Some of the minerals that the body needs include: calcium and phosphorus stored in the bones and teeth, sulfur found in extracellular fluids and bones, and manganese stored in liver and spleen. Vitamins are organic nutrients required in small amounts to maintain growth and normal metabolism. The predominant role of vitamins in the body is to serve as coenzymes. Vitamins are divided into two groups; the fat-soluble and water-soluble vitamins. Fat-Soluble vitamins include A, D, E, and K, Water-soluble vitamins include B and C. The water-soluble vitamins are dissolved in body fluids and distributed while fat-soluble vitamins are stored in the small intestine. Without the proper vitamins and minerals stored throughout the body any number of complications in body functions can occur.

                                Bursting with imagery, motion, interaction and distraction though it is, today’s World Wide Web is still primarily a conduit for textual information. In HTML5, the focus on writing and authorship is more pronounced than ever. It’s evident in the very way that new elements such as article and aside are named. HTML5 asks us to treat the HTML document more as… well, a document.
